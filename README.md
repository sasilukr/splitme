Pay and split bills with your friends at restaurants

Split Me is a point-of-sale app that revolutionizes restaurant CRM (Customer Relationship Management).

Successful CRM relies on the merchant's ability to communicate with its customers. Restaurants using today's POS systems lose valuable information when one person pays for a group meal.

Split Me solves this problem by modernizing the checkout process. Using Split Me, customers can easily split a bill between themselves, providing convenience for themselves and precise information for the restaurant. 

With this specific customer information, stores can encourage social sharing, Yelp reviews, track repeat purchases, offer customized coupons, and measure the ROI of their marketing efforts.
